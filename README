Hello and welcome to your new favorite tool for fitness and nutrition planning! Train Eat Repeat is a Flask application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate personalized workout and meal plans based on user data.

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ The user sends a POST request to the /generate_plan endpoint with their details.
2️⃣ The app formats a prompt for both a workout and meal plan based on the user's information.
3️⃣ The prompts are sent to OpenAI, and the responses are parsed and formatted into plans.
4️⃣ The generated plans are then sent to the user via email.

Pretty cool, huh? 🕺💃
