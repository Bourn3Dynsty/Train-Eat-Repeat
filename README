💪🍎 Personalized Fitness & Nutrition Planner App 🏋️‍♀️🥗
Hello, and welcome to your new favorite tool for fitness and nutrition planning! This Flask application leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate personalized workout and meal plans based on user's data.

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ A user sends a POST request to the /generate_plan endpoint with their details.
2️⃣ The app formats a prompt for both a workout and meal plan, based on the user's details.
3️⃣ These prompts are sent to OpenAI, and the responses are parsed and formatted into plans.
4️⃣ The plans are then sent to the user via email.

Pretty cool, huh? 🕺💃

🔧 Getting Started
Before you can start serving up plans, you'll need to install a few things.

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repo_directory>
You'll need the following environment variables set:

OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key for accessing the GPT-3 API.
PORT: The port your Flask app will run on (defaults to 5000 if not provided).
You'll also need to configure your AWS credentials for sending emails via Amazon SES.
Install the required Python packages with:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Now, you're ready to start your app:

css
Copy code
python main.py
Now your Flask app will be running, and you can start sending POST requests to localhost:<your_port>/generate_plan to generate plans!

📫 Sending Requests
Here's an example of the JSON body your POST request should contain:

json
Copy code
{
  "height": 170,
  "weight": 70,
  "age": 30,
  "sex": "female",
  "bmi": 24.2,
  "fitness_level": "intermediate"
}
If everything goes well, you should receive a response indicating that the plans were sent via email!
